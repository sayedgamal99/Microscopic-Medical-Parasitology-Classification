## 3. Image Data Preprocessing

Image preprocessing is critical for model performance. We used **Keras's ImageDataGenerator** with the following transformations:

- **Data Splits**:
  - **Training Set**: 10,723 images (90%)
  - **Validation Set**: 1,187 images (10%)

- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  1. **Rescaling**: Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1].
  2. **Data Augmentation**:
     - **Rotation**: Random rotation up to 20 degrees.
     - **Horizontal & Vertical Flips**: Introduces variation by flipping images.
     - **Fill Mode**: Uses nearest neighbor fill for empty pixels created by rotations.

- **Data Flow from Directory**:
  - Training images: Loaded from 'train-data' directory.
  - Validation images: Loaded from 'validation-data' directory.
  - Images are resized to 224x224 with a batch size of 32, using categorical class mode for one-hot encoded labels.

## 4. Transfer Learning with ResNet101V2

We employ **ResNet101V2** (pre-trained on ImageNet) with a modified classifier to enhance classification accuracy:

1. **Base Model Setup**:
   - **Input Shape**: (224, 224, 3)
   - **Exclude Top Layers**: Allows addition of custom classifier.

2. **Fine-tuning**:
   - The **base model layers** are trainable for gradual fine-tuning.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Global Average Pooling**: Reduces spatial dimensions.
   - **Dropout Layers**: Prevents overfitting.
   - **Fully Connected Layer**: Dense layer with 1024 units.
   - **Softmax Output**: 15 output units for multi-class classification.



<a name="5-training-configuration-and-callbacks"></a>

## 5. Training Configuration and Callbacks

Several configurations and callbacks enhance the training process:

1. **Learning Rate Schedule**: 
   - Starts at 4.5e-5, decreasing every 8 epochs.

2. **Callbacks**:
   - **LearningRateScheduler**: Adapts learning rate based on epoch count.
   - **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the best-performing model.
   - **EarlyStopping**: Stops training after 12 epochs of no improvement.

3. **Class Weights**:
   - Adjusts for class imbalance, passing calculated weights into `model.fit`.
